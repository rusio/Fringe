    In 1977, in the pages of the ACM SIGART Newsletter, a debate raged over whether
    samefringe is the simplest problem that requires multiprocessing or CoRoutines
    to easily solve... The samefringe problem is this: two binary trees have the
    same fringe if they have exactly the same leaves reading from left to right.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is easy to solve in Haskell, since non-strict evaluation does just
    as much work as necessary to produce a result.

  <pre>
    data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
  
    leaves :: Tree a -> [a]
    leaves (Node left right) = leaves left ++ leaves right
    leaves (Leaf a)          = [a]
  
    sameFringe :: (Eq a) => Tree a -> Tree a -> Bool
    sameFringe a b           = leaves a == leaves b
  </pre>
